        <h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
        <p>
            We are a passionate team of two—Aryan and Shivam—working together to create a seamless and efficient movie ticket booking platform. As BCA students with a shared interest in web development, we wanted to build something practical, user-friendly, and impactful.
            <br /><br />
            Aryan is responsible for designing the UI/UX, front-end development, and backend functionality, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience. Meanwhile, [Friend's Name] contributes by managing the technical aspects, helping with development, and ensuring the platform runs efficiently.
            <br /><br />
            Together, we are committed to making movie ticket booking easy, fast, and hassle-free. Our platform not only allows users to book tickets effortlessly but also provides an admin panel where theater owners can manage movie listings, showtimes, and other details.
            <br /><br />
            We are collaborating on GitHub to bring this project to life, using ASP.NET Web Forms and Azure SQL for database management. Our goal is to create a reliable, user-centric platform that enhances the movie-going experience for everyone.
            <br /><br />
            As we continue to develop and refine our project, we are excited to bring new features and improvements to make ticket booking more convenient than ever. Thank you for being a part of our journey!
