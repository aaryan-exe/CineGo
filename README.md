# TickeFlixx - Movie Ticket Booking Website

Welcome to **TickeFlixx**, my first-ever coding project! This is a simple movie ticket booking website I built as a college assignment to explore web development. Using **ASP.NET Framework, C#, and SQL Database**, I created a platform where users can browse movies and book tickets with ease.

## Project Overview
TickeFlixx lets users:
- Browse a list of movies with details like titles and showtimes.
- Book tickets through a straightforward process.

This was my debut project, so it’s a foundational effort—focused on functionality over polish. It’s been an exciting step into full-stack development!

## Tech Stack
- **ASP.NET Framework**: Core framework for building the web application.
- **C#**: Backend logic and server-side programming.
- **SQL Database**: Stores movie details and booking data.

## Features
- **Movie Browsing**: View available movies and showtimes.
- **Ticket Booking**: Select and confirm movie tickets.
- **Simple UI**: Clean layout leveraging my existing UI design knowledge.
